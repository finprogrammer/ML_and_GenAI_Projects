"""This means it's a lightweight container for storing values (in this case: file paths). The benefit of using a dataclass is that you get automatic __init__, __repr__, and other methods without needing to write boilerplate.

So this class is just used to package the result of the data ingestion step — where the files are stored — into a single object that can be passed to the next pipeline stage"""
